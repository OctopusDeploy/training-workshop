# Part 2 - Student Demos
- Time: ~30 min

## Objective
- Split into pairs, present to each other a short (5 to 10 minutes) demo of the key features you've learned in Part 2

# Demo Framework and Talking points
- Deploy a release to `Test` (you can redeploy an existing one) showing uninterrupted deployment
- Deploy the release to `Production`, showing the Manual Intervention
- Show the deployment process and describe how the intervention step is scoped to just `Production`
- Show the project variable configuration with the student name and its output in a deployment log, describing how variables can be used to influence deployment
- Show the `Environment` variable, explaining how the values for `Environment` are scoped
- Show the Azure App deployment step's `Structured Configuration Variables` area, explaining how the application configuration can be modified
- Show the resulting environment label in two of your web sites to highlight the resulting configuration differences
- Show how the Library Variable Set is linked to the project allowing the Slack URL to be provided to the application
