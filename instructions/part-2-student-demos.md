# Demo Framework and Talking points
Imagine you are continuing the demo you started at the end of Part 1.

Use the framework and talking points below to deliver a short demo of what you've learned in the Part 2.

Feel free to elaborate on any areas you are comfortable speaking about in more detail.

Starting with a release that's ready to be deployed to production:
- Deploy the release to `Production`, showing the Manual Intervention step
- Show the deployment process and describe how the intervention step is scoped to just `Production`
- Return to the dashboard to see the completed deployment
- Show a recent dev environment deployment to highlight the log messages affected by variables and describe how variables can be used to influence deployment
- Show the step configuration to highlight the use of the variable
- Show the project's variable configuration to highlight how it's set up
- Show the `Environment` variable configuration, explaining how the values for `Environment` are scoped
- Show how the Library Variable Set is linked to the project allowing the Slack URL to be provided to the application
- Return to a deployment summary to indicate the result of the scoped variable and the message about the Library Set variable
- Show the Azure App deployment step's `Structured Configuration Variables` area, explaining how the application configuration can be modified
