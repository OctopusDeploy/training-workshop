# Part 2 - Student Demos
- Time: ~20 min

## Objective
- Split into pairs, present to each other a short (5 to 10 minutes) demo of the key features you've learned in Part 2

# Demo Framework and Talking points
- Deploy a release to Test (you can redeploy an existing one)
- Deploy the release to Production, showing the Manual Intervention
- Show the deployment process and describe how the intervention step is scoped to just Production
- Show the student name variable configuration and its output in a deployment log, describing how variables can be used to influence deployment
- Show the `Environment` and `ConfigFile` variables, explaining how `Environment` is scoped
- Show the Azure App deployment step's `Structured Configuration Variables` area, explaining how the application configuration can be modified
- Show the resulting environment label in two of your web sites to highlight the resulting configuration differences
- Show how the Library Variable Set is linked to the project allowing the Slack URL to be configured for the application.
