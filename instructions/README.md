# Welcome to the Octopus basics workshop!

This training workshop is designed to build a fundamental understanding of Octopus Deploy, its place in the CI/CD ecosystem, and the value it provides to a typical deployment pipeline workflow.

The workshop will teach you the basics by using Octopus Deploy to deploy a web application to some infrastructure where you can see it running.

## Goals and outcomes
- to understand and speak confidently about where Octopus Deploy fits into the CI/CD process
- to understand the overall value proposition of the Octopus Deploy product
- ability to explain the core features
- ability to perform a basic demo of the product

## Guided Workshop
This workshop is normally delivered as a guided experience. This provides the students with guidance and assistance along the way. The lessons begin with slides and a discussion about the concepts being discussed.

You can find the slides for the workshop at the following Google Drive URL:

# Quick Info

These instructions have been customized for you for your convenience. Here you'll find a quick reference to the important information about your customized experience. You can refer to this page for the general links you'll need to visit during the workshop.

## Student ID "Slug"

The setup for your experience in this workshop has created a number of resources for your use. Most of these are identified uniquely for you using an ID "slug". This is a text identifier made up of parts of your name and a unique generated ID (to avoid any possible collisions between student names).

Your slug is: `[student-slug]`

This value will show up in some lessons when you need to select resources from a list.

## GitHub Branch

A shiny new GitHub branch has been created for you in the workshop repository. You won't be doing a lot here, but it serves as a components of the workshop activities and you will be returning to it towards the end to make a couple modifications. It's yours, so don't worry about messing anything up for anyone else.

Chances are, you're already viewing these instructions on your branch but for your reference, here is its URL:

https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/training-workshop/tree/student/[student-slug]


## Octopus Space

A new Space inside the Octopus Deploy workshop training Cloud instance has been created for you. This is where you'll spend most of your time performing the tasks that make up the workshop lessons.

https://octopus-training.octopus.app/app#/[space-id]

## Azure Web Sites

Finally, several web site services hosted in Azure have been set up to serve as the infrastructure to which you'll be deploying the workshop's sample web application. Right now they have just the default web application Microsoft provides when you first stand up one of these services. But as you complete the lessons they'll contain the workshop's sample application.

Hosting services have been created to represent the typical environments a software development team would deploy to. Here are the unique URLs for your instances of these services for each of the environments:

- Development: [student-app-url-dev]
- Test: [student-app-url-test]
- Production: [student-app-url-prod]

You'll find links to these applications throughout the workshop when you need to visit them again to see the results of the actions you've performed.
