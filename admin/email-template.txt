Here's the information you'll need to know to get started with the Octopus Basics hands-on workshop sessions.

Before you can access the instructions linked below, you'll need to ensure that you have an active GitHub account (https://github.com).
You can create one using your regular Octopus Google account.


BEFORE THE WORKSHOP
Customized instructions have been created for you in GitHub.
You can find them here: [instruction-link]

Please read over just the instructions page prior to the workshop. You don't need to start any of the lessons.
At the end of the instructions page is the "Before your session" section.
There's a link to a short (~8 min) video to watch.

Also, make sure you can access the session classroom. See below for details.

JOINING THE SESSION
The workshop sessions will be hosted in Gather.
You can log in with your regular GSuite account.
If you'd like to customize your avatar, you certainly can, or just take the random one they create for you.
