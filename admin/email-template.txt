<h1>Workshop Info</h1>
<p>
Here's the information you'll need to know to get started with your upcoming Octopus Basics hands-on workshop sessions.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Before the Workshop</h2>
Customized instructions have been created for you in GitHub.<br />
You can find them here: [instruction-link]
</p>
<p>
Please read over just the first welcome page (linked to above) prior to the workshop. You don't need to start any of the lessons.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong>Important: Please complete this list before the session. Not being prepared will slow everyone down.</strong></em>
<ul>
<li>At the end of the instructions page is the "Before your session" section, please review it.</li>
<li>Make sure you can access the session classroom. See below for details. Please test your access and ensure that you can share your screen or browser (Macs are finicky with permissions, sharing just the browser window is sometimes easier).</li>
<li>Please try to have some kind of earphone (buds, headset, etc.). This is an interactive session and participation/questions are encouraged, but feedback/echo is problematic (and Gather behaves different than Zoom).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h2>Joining the Session</h2>
The workshop sessions will be hosted in Gather.Town. You can log in with your regular GSuite account.<br />
If you'd like to customize your avatar, you certainly can, or just take the random one they create for you.<br />
</p>
<p>
Classroom access info is in the session invite.<br />
